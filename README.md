## Lessons Learned

What did you learn while building this project? What challenges did you face and how did you overcome them?

- I learned how to use redux... Still need to spend more time with it to get comfortable with the syntax and all, but it seems super powerful.
- I learned about the basic logic that makes up a shopping list.
- I practiced testing components

- It was difficult to get my tests working because I was using an old version of react/rtl/etc... It took some troubleshooting but I googled my way through it.
